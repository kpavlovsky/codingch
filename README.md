This is made from Next.js --ts template

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


## How it works and where it works:

It works locally.

I have deployed it on vercel, but it is pointless because csv file is not in the server build and I am way over the time to fix it.




I have spent a little more time than I thought on the algo.
I didn't use any other dependencies besides `csv`.


Later found that some of the stuff could be done with library d3, but I have managed to get away with a bunch of loops/filters/etc
